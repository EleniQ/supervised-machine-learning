# Supervised Machine Learning 

### Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier 

* I have built two models, one on LR and one RFC model. The models predict the outcome of "loan status" based on the training data.
* I picked the number 21 as the random state, as it is my favourite number. 
* I predict that RFC will produce a more accurate model, and whilst the training data shows this to be correct, the testing data scores have neglible difference to 4dp.
* I believe that this shows that the data provided has a linear relationship within it, allowing the LR model to predict correctly to high accuracy. 
* RFC overall was still more preicse, but not by much. This came as a slight surpise to me!
